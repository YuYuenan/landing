          <h2>Chihiro</h2>
          <p>A 10-year-old fourth-grader moves with her parents to a new town, and on the way there, she mistakenly enters a world where ghosts and spirits rest. In order to save her parents from being turned into pigs, she stays at the bathhouse "Yuya" with the help of Kohaku and grows up. In order to control the people who come here, she changes her name to Kodachi. In the end, she helps Shiryu remember her name and breaks the spell on her body.</p>

          <h2>Haku</h2>
          <p>A dragon who used to live in a river called "Amber River" in the human world, but became homeless when the river was buried by humans, and came to the soup kitchen to learn magic under Grandma Yumi, and is the actual manager of the bathhouse, and Grandma Yumi's right-hand man. He saved Chihiro from falling into the water when she was young and remembers her name. For this reason he ventured to give Chihiro a lot of help.</p>

          <h2>Yubāba</h2>
          <p>She is the head of the bathhouse "Yuya" and the town administrator. She often goes out as a big bird with black wings and orders anyone who doesn't work to be turned into a pig and eaten, and those who work for her have their names taken away so that if they can't remember them, they will never leave her bathhouse. However, she treats her bathhouse guests with obedience and smiles, and spends her days in her room counting money and keeping accounts, a complete image of a miserly little boss.

          <h2>Zenība</h2>
          <p>Yubāba's twin sister, though basically indistinguishable from Yubāba in terms of characterisation, is a gentle and kindly person, and Zenība, like Yubāba, is a witch with powerful magical powers. She and Yubāba look the same, even the ring she wears on her hand is the same. But she and Yubāba have been on bad terms since childhood, so she lives alone in a suburban hut far from the bathhouse.</p>

          <h2>Bō</h2>
          <p>Yubāba's only son wears a belly-band with the word " Bo" printed on it. Although he was very large, he looked like a baby and stayed in a room full of toys and pillows because he was afraid of "germs", and like most children, he liked to threaten people by crying. Later, Zenība turns him into a little mouse who travels with Chihiro, and he grows up considerably.</p>
